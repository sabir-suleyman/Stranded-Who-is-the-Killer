# Name of the Game
Our game is called "**Stranded: Who's the Killer?**"

# Game Plot:
The game features a serial killer and our main character. The serial killer has imprisoned our character on an island and promises that he will not kill him and will surrender if he finds him with the clues he gives him. Our character starts to follow the clues to save his life and to reveal the identity of the killer who took the lives of his loved ones.

# Levels in the game and their details:

## Level 1 (Awakening)

At the very beginning the character is awakened. When he wakes up, the only event he remembers clearly is the moment he was kidnapped and he wakes up scared. He finds a scroll, opens it and finds a puzzle (the difficulty of the puzzle will depend on the level). When the puzzle is solved, the scroll gives the character a map. With this map the character finds the hut.

## Level 2 (Hut)

As soon as we pass, the screen turns black and the player is informed that we have passed to level 2. The character entering the hut can see the surroundings. There is a bed, an old table, an old shelf and books. There is also an old chest at the end of the bed. The character opens the chest and finds a shattered photograph inside. When he puts this photo together, he finds suspects. After seeing the suspects for the first time, the character returns to the table and finds an old diary on the table. When the diary is opened, the character finds 4 pages with different themes (numerical, logical, verbal, auditory) on each page. Each new solution reveals a photo of each character in the photo and brief information about them, and according to the information we get an idea about the suspects. When the puzzles are finished, the diary closes and it gets dark. For this reason, our character starts looking around, finds a torch and somehow lights it. When he lights the torch, he suddenly sees a drawing on the wall that he has never seen before. This drawing directs the character outside.

## Level 3 (Introducing the character to the outside)
We are told that we have reached level 3. Since it is now dark, the character wanders around with a torch for a while. Then he comes across some footprints. He follows these footprints. The tracks branch at some points, there are exactly 4 branches. The character makes a choice at each fork in the road. He makes these choices based on old clues (e.g. the bow in the hair of the female suspect in the diary, the badge on the lapel of the young sailor man who is the other suspect, the bloodied handkerchief of the oldest suspect, and the broken glasses of the last suspect, a middle-aged man). If he gets the choice wrong, the character dies on the way. But if he can find the killer, he finds the secret cave that the killer used to get off the island and faces one last puzzle. In the cave he finds there is a box. The box opens with a light, at the same time the wind blows and the torch goes out, and a challenging puzzle appears. If this puzzle can be solved, the cave lights up and a key appears in the box. The character who opens the door with this key finishes the game and finds the killer.
